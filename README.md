# ASL-Finger-Spelling

In this project, I compare the accuracy on ASL Fingerspelling translator using supervised             
machine learning.The final system is able to classify 24 different symbols with reasonable             
accuracy.
So in order to recognize the various finger spelled letters we tried various algorithms and later               
compared the accuracybythesealgorithmsnamelyCNN,SVMandANN.AccuracyforSVMwas            
way better when compared to SVM and CNN. The accuracy for CNN was nearly 88% when compared to SVM which was with accuracy of    
about 100%.
